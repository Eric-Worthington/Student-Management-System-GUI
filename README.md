# Student-Management-System-GUI

Developed a desktop application in Python using Tkinter to manage student records, with support for both undergraduate and graduate students. Leveraged object-oriented programming with custom Student and GradStudent classes to capture distinct data attributes. The interface included interactive widgets for data entry, major selection, and thesis input, and allowed users to add, edit, and view records in real-time through event-driven programming and GUI state management.
